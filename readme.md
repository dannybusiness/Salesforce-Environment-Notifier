###Salesforce Environment Notifier###

This Chrome extension adds a notifier to the top of any Salesforce page letting you know whether it is a live environment or sandbox. This determination is currently based solely on my usage but I hope to make it cusomisable in the future. To set up: 

* Enable developer mode in Chrome
* Download Repository
* Naigate to the extensions menu and select 'Load Unpacked Extension'
